BUILDING FROM SOURCE:
=====================
  	 
1. Run "mvn clean package -DskipTests" from directory UID_CLIENT_PROJECT_HOME (where you unzipped source code).

2. To develop code in Eclipse, perform following steps:
   i)   Run "mvn eclipse:eclipse" from UID_CLIENT_PROJECT_HOME directory.
   ii)  Launch Eclipse and create a new workspace.
   iii) Right click in an empty area in "Project Explorer", and select menu option "Import...".
   iv)  In the "Import" dialog, select option "General -> Existing project into workspace",
        and browse to directory UID_CLIENT_PROJECT_HOME for option "Select root directory:".
        Click "Finish"
   v)   All the projects will be imported in Eclipse.
   vi)  If you have project that provides biometric integration API implementation, you will have to add it to the class path of
        the "uidai-sample-gui-app" project.  Also, update the value of field, biometricAPIImplementationClass, in the SampleClientMainFrame.java
		to the value of the class that implements the API.
   vi)  Select the "SampleClientMainFrame.java" file from "uidai-sample-gui-app" project
        and run it as a "Java" application.

   After launching the application, Use menu "Edit->Preferences" and modify values as needed.
